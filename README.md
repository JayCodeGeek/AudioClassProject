# AudioClassProject

This is project is all about using addEventListener() and adding Audio() to individual animal.
I've added few animal images and applied respective audio when clicked on animal.
I learned about concept like new keyword, object, instance and constructor function and also about setTimeout() function.
With help of for loop and switch statement i've reduced the lines of code and made project efficient.
